						<h2>About Us</h2>
						<p>RedRock Life has been around since 2010 in one form or another. It all started when Mrs. Red was feeling sick and tired. Not a normal sick and tired, but <b>thoroughly tired, tired to the core</b>. Well, Mr. Red started researching Chinese medicines and found out that when people's bodies are tired they are not in harmony with life, energy, and God.</p><br/>
						<p>Generally speaking, the standardized applications of Chinese herbs began since the publishing of Shang Han Lun and Jin Gui Yao Lue, <i>The Treatise on Cold Damage Disorders and Miscellaneous Illnesses</i>, collated by Zhang Zhongjing, who is deemed as the founding father of Classic Formulas. This book can date back to the end of the Han dynasty, almost two thousand years ago.</p><br/>
						<p>Unlike western medicine, which is developed around a basic theory, the method of pattern diagnosis is very different. Without the help of modern machines, the ancients couldn't know the true nature of pathological changes. What they could lay their hands on was the visible and touchable symptoms and signs, which more often than not would lead them to the false belief that these superficial phenomena are the pathogenesis of the diseases. But now we know that they are not.</p><br/>
						<p>Since this method is so rough, <b>does it really work?</b> That is the most frequently asked question in terms of herbal healing. We must answer it well before we can obtain confidence. Picture the harsh conditions in primitive times. Lacking crop cultivation techniques, they could do nothing but hunt animals or gather plants to survive. This is such a long-term process of trial and error that can barely be imagined by a person who is living a modern city life. They learned the hard way, and it even cost many deaths to trade for some revelation. There would be a long and flat learning curve, and they might make terrible mistakes to tell which wild fruits, seeds, and tubers were edible and curative. That wisdom is not born but acquired.</p><br/>
						<p>After reading many Chinese books and learning and experimenting with different American Herbs, Mr. Red put Cayenne Pepper, Ginger, Ginseng, Milk Thistle, and Lecithin together to create the first and original RedRock Life Capsule. It was beautiful, a mix of these herbs, some from his garden and some from trusted Herbal Suppliers.</p><br/>
						<p>Slowly, Mr. and Mrs. Red started sharing them and would always tell people: <i>use more cayenne pepper in your food, stop eating black pepper completely and switch to cayenne!</i> For the four years, Mr. and Mrs. Red <b>did not get sick</b>, they were <b>not as tired</b>, and they <b>just felt better</b>. They saw others who were sick, who were tired, and they suggested: <i>just try some cayenne pepper</i>.</p><br/>
